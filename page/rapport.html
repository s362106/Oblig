            <h2> Intro</h2>
        </main>
        <p> In our first assignment of the semester in HTML, we had to choose between to options, option a and option b.
            We chose the latter.
            In this option we had to create a webpage for a fictional restaurant. The page had to have seven dishes,
            between three courses.
            Each dish should have main ingredients as well as allergens. Finding opening hours, location and contact
            information must be easy.
        </p>
        <h2> Preparation
        </h2>
        <p> First time we sat down together, and we looked at different designs on the internet as inspiration for our own
            restaurant.
            This gave us ideas as to how we want to structure our page and what fonts we thought was perfect for it.
            Then we inspected the html code in those pages to see what they did in areas we liked.
            But of course, our page was not going to be that complicated as those we found, so we had to simplify our
            code.
            Once we loosely decided on the design of the page, we created a repository in GitHub in order for us all to
            work on it.
            In there we created folders for images and pages. In this way it is easier for us to see everything we have
            in the repository.
        </p>
        <p>As on almost all modern webpages, we had to ensure universal accessibility. We thought of people who use
            screen readers first.
            So, we had to make sure that we used semantic tags like &lt;em&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt; for example. </p>
