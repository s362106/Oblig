            <h2>Intro</h2>
        </main>
        <p> In our first assignment of the semester in HTML, we had to choose between to options, option a and option b.
            We chose the latter. In this option we had to create a webpage for a fictional restaurant. The page had to
            have seven dishes, between three courses. Each dish should have main ingredients as well as allergens.
            Finding opening hours, location and contact information must be easy.
        </p>
        <h2> Preparation
        </h2>
        <p> First time we sat down together, we looked at different designs on the internet for inspiration for our own
            restaurant website. These gave us ideas as to how we want to structure our page and what fonts we thought
            was perfect for it. After we decided on our structure and layout, we inspected html codes from other
            websites to see how they did what they did in areas we liked. But of course, our page was not going to be
            that complicated as those we found, so we had to simplify our code. Once we loosely decided on the design of
            the page, we created a repository in GitHub for us all to work on it. In there we created folders for images
            and pages. In this way it is easier for us to see everything we have in the repository.
        </p>
        <p>As on almost all modern webpages, we had to ensure universal accessibility. We thought of people who use
            screen readers first.
            So, we had to make sure that we used semantic tags like, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt; ,&lt;em&gt;
            instead of &lt;i&gt; for instance. We also made sure to make the page as easy and simple as possible, but
            also aesthetically pleasant. </p>
        <h2> Version 1.0</h2>
        <p>
            The first version of the page had some of those accessibility issues. We used the italic tag(&lt;i&gt;)
            instead of
            the emphasis tag (&lt;em&gt;), so we had to fix the problem. Another issue was that we forgot to add a title
            in the head. The title element(&lt;title&gt;) is very important as it defines a title in the browser
            toolbar. It is
            also important when it comes to search engine results as it gives the page a title (as the name
            suggests) for results. It also provides a title for the page when it is added to favourites.
