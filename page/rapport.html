        <p> In our first assignment of the semester in HTML, we had to choose between to options, option a and option b.
            We chose the latter.
            In this option we had to create a webpage for a fictional restaurant. The page had to have seven dishes,
            between three courses.
            Each dish should have main ingredients as well as allergens. Finding opening hours, location and contact
            information must be easy.
        </p>
        <h2> Preparation
        </h2>
        <p>As on almost all modern webpages, we had to ensure universal accessibility. We thought of people who use screen readers first. 
            So, we had to make sure that we used semantic tags like &lt;em&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt; for example. </p>
